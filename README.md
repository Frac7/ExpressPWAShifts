# ExpressPWAShifts
Basic PoC to show how to notify (push) a subscriber PWA

# Overview
This project was created with:
- Express to manage REST APIs;
- Cron Node to manage the push notification schedule;
- Web Push to manage encryption and sending notifications.

## Registration flow
1) First, the PWA has to query the server to get the public key for the encryption step: `GET /public-key`;
2) Then the PWA has to send the subscription details to the server: `POST /subscription`.

For simplicity, each subscription is stored in a simple in-memory data structure. Each subscription is identified by the endpoint, see [Introduction to push notification](https://developers.google.com/web/ilt/pwa/introduction-to-push-notifications).

A scheduled job runs every day at 8:00 am - the server sends a notification for each registered client.

## Get the turns
The last endpoint exposed by this application is `GET /`, which returns shifts for a certain date. Shifts are mocked within the application.

# Getting started
Generate VAPID keys and save them in the .env file using `webPush.generateVAPIDKeys ()`. `webPush` derives from the` web-push` package. See [Push](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Progressive_web_apps/Re-engageable_Notifications_Push#push).

Run the following command: `yarn install && yarn start`
